Ques 1. List the operators in Java.

Ans 1. *List of operators in Java:*
   - Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
   - Relational Operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
   - Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
   - Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
   - Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
   - Increment/Decrement Operators: ++, --
   - Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator): ? :
   - instanceof Operator
   - Bitwise Shift Operators: <<, >>, >>>


Ques 2. Explain about increment and decrement operators and give an example of each.

Ans 2. *Increment and Decrement Operators:*
   - Increment Operator (++): Increases the value of the operand by 1.
     Example: int x = 5; x++; // After this, x will be 6
   - Decrement Operator (--): Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
     Example: int y = 8; y--; // After this, y will be 7


Ques 3. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?

Ans 3. *Conditional Operators in Java:*
  Conditional or Logical  AND	&&
  Conditional or Logical  OR	||
  Ternary Operator	        ?:

Ques 4. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?

Ans 4. *Types of Operators based on the Number of Operands:*
   - Unary Operators: Operate on one operand (e.g., ++x, -y)
   - Binary Operators: Operate on two operands (e.g., x + y, a * b)
   - Ternary Operator: Operates on three operands (e.g., x > y ? x : y)


Ques 5. What are the conditional statements and use of conditional statements in Java?

Ans 5. *Conditional Statements and Use in Java:*
   - Conditional statements include if, else if, and else.
   - They are used to make decisions in the program flow based on specified conditions.


Ques 6.  What is the syntax of if else statement?

Ans 6. *Syntax of if-else Statement:*
   java
   if (condition) {
       // Code to be executed if the condition is true
   } else {
       // Code to be executed if the condition is false
   }

   
Ques 7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?

Ans 7. *3 Types of Iterative Statements in Java:*
   - for loop
   - while loop
   - do-while loop


Ques 8. What do you mean by an array?

Ans 8. *Array:*
   - An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.


Ques 9. How to create an array?

Ans 9. *How to Create an Array:*
   java
   // Syntax for creating an array of integers
   int[] myArray = new int[5];

   
Ques 10. State the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in Java.

Ans 10. *Difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder:*
    - StringBuffer is synchronized (thread-safe), while StringBuilder is not.
    - StringBuffer is generally slower than StringBuilder due to synchronization.
    - If thread safety is not a concern, it's recommended to use StringBuilder for better performance.
